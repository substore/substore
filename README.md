# Substore

Hello!

This project is a work in progress, hope to have this shipped by summer.

The remaining significant task involves designing the user interface, as well as configuring the entire codebase for self-hosting. Currently, our databases are deployed on fly.io, but we intend to shift to bare-metal for the non self-hostable version of substore.

## Stack
This is a brief rundown of our stack at the moment

- Rust (For CLI)
- TypeScript & GraphQL (For the backend, provisioning dbs, sending emails etc)
- React/Next (For the UI of course)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! I will try my best to create issues for todos, I still have to write a contributing doc for Substore that shows what tools to install, what commands to run etc.
